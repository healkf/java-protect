This is my first Java protection tool. It includes class encryption, a custom class loader, launcher, anti-debug, self-check, and string obfuscation. It can be integrated into other protection systems.
- Encrypted class loader
- Launcher for protected JARs
- Anti-debug mechanisms
- Self-check / integrity verification
- String obfuscation
- Easy integration into other protection systems

Requirements: Java 17+ ; Gradle
